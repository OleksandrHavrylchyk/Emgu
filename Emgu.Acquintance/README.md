# â„–7 Acquaintance with the library
Purpose: To get acquainted with the OpenCV library. Learn how to upload images using OpenCV.

To study OpenCV I found Emgu - wrapper that allows to work with OpenCV using .NET and C#, so I desided to use it.

Emgu.Acquaintance - project in which I installed and created simple picture loading with preview.
For setting up Emgu for project I used official  [documentation][doc]

There I also found simple example with picture loading

            OpenFileDialog openFile = new OpenFileDialog();
            if (openFile.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
            {
                Image<Bgr, byte> myImage = new Image<Bgr, byte>(openFile.FileName);
                pictureBox1.Image = myImage.ToBitmap();
            }
